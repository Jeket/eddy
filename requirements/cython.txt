# Cython requirements
# 
# Stick with 0.26 as new versions cause issues with pyjnius<=1.1.1
#
# https://github.com/kivy/pyjnius/issues/300
#
# As of Oct 22, 2018 pyjnius has updated to 1.1.3 effectively closing issue #300,
# we cannot however update to 1.1.3 as it causes problems with cx_Freeze.
# In particular, jnius_config relies on resource_filename from pkg_resources
# to add Java classes from the jnius package to the classpath, and for this to work
# in the bundled version of Eddy it is required for jnius_config to be left outside 
# of the zip file, which is not currently possible in cx_Freeze 5.1.1 for single file modules.

# From PyPi
Cython==0.26
