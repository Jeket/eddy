## pyGraphol

### Description

pyGraphol is design tool for the Graphol language written in python. [Graphol] is developed by members 
of the DASI-lab group  of the [Dipartimento di Informatica e Sistemistica "A.Ruberti"] at [Sapienza] 
University of Rome. Graphol offers a  completely visual representation of ontologies to users, in 
order to help understanding by people who are not skilled in logic. Graphol provides designers with 
simple graphical primitives for ontology editing, avoiding complex textual syntax. Graphol's basic 
components are inspired by Entity Relationship (ER) diagrams, thus ontologies that can be rendered as 
ER diagrams have in Graphol a similar diagrammatic shape.
